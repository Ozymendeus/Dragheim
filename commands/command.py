#            self.key - the name of this command ('look')

#            self.cmdstring - the actual command name used to call this
#                             (this allows you to know which alias was used,
#                              for example)
#            self.args - the raw input; everything following self.cmdstring.
#            self.cmdset - the cmdset from which this command was picked. Not
#                          often used (useful for commands like 'help' or to
#                          list all available commands etc)

#                          the same as self.caller.

#
#           name[ with several words][/switch[/switch..]] arg1[,arg2,...] [[=|,] arg[,..]]
#
#         The 'name[ with several words]' part is already dealt with by the
#         cmdhandler at this point, and stored in self.cmdname (we don't use
#         it here). The rest of the command is stored in self.args, which can
#         start with the switch indicator /.
#
#         This parser breaks self.args into its constituents and stores them in the
#         following variables:
